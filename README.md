# Weather Forecast App

This is an Angular application that fetches weather forecast data from an API and visualizes it using Chart.js. The app displays a line chart representing the temperature data for different locations.

## Features

- Home screen with weather forecasting options:
  - District of Columbia Forecast (LWX)
  - Kansas Forecast (TOP)
- Each option redirects to a weather-specific page with the corresponding forecast identifier (e.g., `/weather/LWX`, `/weather/TOP`).
- Fetches data from a weather API and retrieves temperature forecasts.
- Parses the JSON response and extracts necessary data for the chart.
- Displays a line chart using Chart.js.
- Customizable chart appearance, including labels, colors, and tooltips.
- Redirects any unknown routes to the home screen.
